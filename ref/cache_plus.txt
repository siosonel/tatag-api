Cache+ processing pattern: 

Unless overriden semantically or via specified means
in the underlying media type or profile, the generic client
implements these cache pattern:


1. The target resource and any embedded resource(s) are cached by default.

2. Cached resources are indexed by @id, _links.self.href, or equivalent.

3. When the server responds with a resource that is currently cached:

-     A cached resource that maches the @id of the target resource in the 
      server response will be fully replaced.

-     A cached resource that matches the @id of an embedded resource in the 
      server response will be partially updated as follows: each property in 
      the embedded resource will be added to the cached resource if missing, or
      if not missing, used to replace the cached property value. 

4. Recommended client feature: A generic client should provide a cache 
update notification feature, to help an application minimize
conflicting active views of the same data that has been rendered at different
time points.
