Get Started Helper Features

***********************
     Rough Design
***********************

identify concepts
- by audience, including a sublist of supporting resources

suggest semantic mapping
- use popular services to suggest link relation terms and href

feedback on resource map
- reachability
- term frequency
- potential bottlenecks

      Test Drive
***********************

The following features require actual server-generated resource 
representations, as well as a generic client for each indicated 
media type or profile.

navigation test  
- verify map routing from root document (test actual reachability)
- predicted cache hit ratio

expectations test
- validate resource against current or new 'shapes'
- validate deprecation support, if applicable

auto-generate documentation
- use the resource_concepts.json as a starting point
- use semantic mapping to explain links rels or terms 
- trigger the generation of resource 'shapes', to be used as examples
